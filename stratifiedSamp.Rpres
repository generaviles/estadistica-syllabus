What is Stratified Sampling?
========================================================

Population is partitioned in non-overlaping groups, called **strata** and a **sample** is collected from each stratum following a determined design.

Why use Stratified Sampling?
========================================================
<br \>
- May produce smaller error when estimating than simple random sample. Specially when measurements within strata have realitve small variation.
- Cost by observation reduced.
- There may be a need to have a subgroup (stratum) with similar estimates of those of the population.


Math Approach
========================================================

Assuming that:
- $L$ = num. of strata.
- $N_h$ = num. of units in each stratum $h$.
- $n_h$ = num. of samples taken from stratum $h$.
- $N$ = total number of units in the population.
